# Hello Class!

This is my first assignment for IML 400 

## What's in this project?

+ Envisioning a Goober world that surpasses our generation, I found imagery of current bio-inspired furniture. They happened to be documented in places of nature as well. These 5 images were then slightly manipulated to fit on one page together.
And subsequent Goobers would occcupy their space.

I decided to keep the clickable functions as is.
